## Synopsis

This is the software the produces the [UAF (United Access Framework) clean catalog] (ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/geoide/geoIDECleanCatalog.html) of high-quality netCDF Earth Science data sets from the raw catalogs.

## Motivation

UAF is working to build momentum towards the goal of increased data integration and interoperability. The goal of this tool is to automatically crawl a remote OPeNDAP or THREDDS server, and from the information in the server build a "clean" catalog of data that will be: a) served through uniform access services; b) have CF compliant metadata; c) directly link the data to common visualization tools there
by allowing users to immediately begin exploring actual data.
